With up to 2.5 million hours MTBF, Ultrastar hard drives deliver reliability and durability, are built for yearly operation (24x7x365) within the most demanding storage environments.HelioSeal TechnologyFeatured in over 30 million Western Digital hard drives shipped, HelioSeal technology allows for higher capacities and lower power on large storage arrays. And now on its 5th generation design, HelioSeal technology is field-tested and proven to deliver high capacity, reliability, and power efficiency you can trust.Vibration ProtectionEnhanced Rotational Vibration Safeguard (RVS) technology uses sophisticated electronics to monitor the drive and correct linear and rotational vibrations in real time for improved performance versus traditional desktop drives in high-vibration environments.Dynamic Fly-height TechnologyEach read-write head's fly height is adjusted in real time to ensure consistent performance for reduced errors and optimized reliability.Dual-stage Actuator TechnologyUltrastar drives feature a dual-stage actuator head positioning system for a high degree of accuracy. The primary stage provides course displacement while the secondary stage uses piezoelectric motion to fine tune the head positioning to a higher degree of precision. Compatibility testingAll Ultrastar hard drives are extensively tested across a variety of popular OEM storage systems, SATA controllers, and host bus adapters to ensure ease of integration for a plug and play solution.7200 RPM-ClassThis family of 7200 RPM-class hard drives delivers the fastest performance with the highest workload rating of any drive in Western Digital's hard drive lineup.",

Why does helium make a difference? Helium has only one-seventh the density of air. Replacing air with helium inside a hard drive dramatically reduces the turbulence caused by the spinning disk, cuts power consumption and results in a lower temperature within the disk drive. The reduction in turbulence for the spinning disk allows HGST to offer a seven-disk design in a traditional 3.5-inch form factor. In addition to being the world’s first helium-filled hard drive, HGST Ultrastar He6 is also the first hard drive in the industry to offer a 6-terabyte capacity.
