It is an electrically non-conductive paste that is applied between CPU / GPU and designated coolers to transfer the dissipated heat from the components to the heat sink. Since the ARCTIC MX-4 is a metal-free compound, it eliminates the risks of causing short circuit and in turn adding more protection to your computer. The new formula in the ARCTIC MX-4 features optimal thermal conductivity and low thermal resistance. These characteristics effectively dissipate the emitted heat from the core components. The consistency of the ARCTIC MX-4 is designed for simple application. Its texture is just thin enough to spread onto components using fingers without creating much mess.",

Thanks to its extremely low thermal resistance as well as excellent pliability and spreadability, NT-H1 achieves outstanding results.Maximum ease of use & efficient dosageAs NT-H1 spreads very well under pressure, there's no need to smear it over the heat-spreader. This reduces both the consumption of paste and the time spent on the installation process: Put one drop of NT-H1 onto the centre of your CPU, install the cooler and that's it!Top-performance right from the startNT-H1 reaches its full performance extremely fast and doesn't require a longer \"burn-in\" time.Excellent long-term stabilityNT-H1 doesn't contain any solvents or other substances with low flash point and provides excellent long-term stability. Due to the compound's exceptional curing, bleeding, dry-out und thermal cycling characteristics, NT-H1 can be used for several years without any problems.Not electrically conductive, non-corrodingNT-H1 possesses a very low dielectric constant and a high dielectric strength. Therefore, there's no danger of short-circuits even in case of direct contact with components or conducting paths. Fully compatible with all materials commonly employed in PC environments, NT-H1 is suited for use with aluminium and copper coolers.Suitable for compressor coolingNT-H1 is perfectly suited for use with compressor coolers. Even at the very lowest temperatures, the paste delivers full performance and remains easy to clean off.",

    "Features": "Tri-Linear Ceramic Content:\nLike the original Ceramique, Ceramique 2 uses only ceramic fillers so it is neither electrically conductive nor capacitive. The tri-linear composite of aluminum oxide, zinc oxide and boron nitride allows the thinnest possible bond line with modern processors, heatsinks and electronics. Critically-sized particles and new ultra-high shear mixing techniques maximize Ceramique 2's thermal performance and help maintain a stable homogenous suspension. This exclusive combination provides performance exceeding most metal based compounds.\n\nPolysynthetic Suspension Fluid:\nA new oil mixture, improved thermal filler properties and increased particle deagglomeration, dispersal and density enhance Ceramique 2's thermal performance and overall stability. The third generation polysynthetic suspension fluid combines advanced synthetic oils to maximize wetting and stability while allowing a higher density of thermally conductive fillers.\n\nExcellent Stability:\nCeramique 2 is engineered to not separate, run, migrate, or bleed.\n\nElectrical Insulator:\nCeramique 2 does not contain any metal or other electrically conductive materials. It is a pure electrical insulator, neither electrically conductive nor capacitive.\n\nPerformance:\n2 to 10 degrees centigrade lower CPU full load core temperatures than standard thermal compounds or thermal pads when measured with a calibrated thermal diode imbedded in the CPU core.\n\nInnovative Dispenser:\nThe amount of compound remaining in the 2.7-gram syringe is easy to determine as the rear of the plunger is perfectly flush with the flange when the syringe is empty.\n\nEasy Clean Up:\nCeramique 2 can easily be cleaned from CPUs and heatsinks with ArctiClean, isopropyl alcohol or any of the cleaners listed in the product instructions.\n\nCompliancy:RoHS Compliant.",

    "Features ": "65mm low profileDue to its compact heatsink and the 14mm thin NF-A9x14 low profile fan, the NH-L9x65 stands only 65mm tall (the same height as low-profile expansion cards), which makes it ideal for use in compact HTPCs or Small Form Factor cases that offer limited clearance for CPU coolers.100% RAM compatibility on Intel platformsThe NH-L9x65 has a 95x95mm footprint that complies exactly to the Intel LGA115x socket keep-out zone. This means that it won’t cause issues with chipset coolers and doesn’t overhang the RAM slots, making it fully compatible with tall memory modules.100% compatibility with PCIe cards on ITXMany Intel LGA115x based mini-ITX mainboards have the PCIe slot sitting close to the 95x95mm socket zone. While larger coolers that exceed this zone may block the PCIe slot, the 95x95xmm sized NH-L9i provides full compatibility with PCIe cards.Easy access to near-socket connectorsMany low-profile coolers use larger fans or heatsinks in order to achieve sufficient cooling performance, but protruding over the socket zone, they make it difficult or even impossible to reach near-socket connectors on tightly packed ITX mainboards. Thanks to its 95x95mm footprint, the NH-L9x65 provides easy access to all connectors and components.NF-A9x14 PWM premium fanThe highly optimised NF-A9x14 premium fan features Noctua’s proprietary AAO frame as well as sophisticated aerodynamic design measures. Supporting PWM for fully automatic speed control, the NF-A9x14 allows the NH-L9x65 to stay remarkably quiet.",

    "Features ": "High-compatibility version of NH-D15Compared to the award-winning NH-D15, the S-version uses an off-set, asymmetrical layout and a single instead of dual NF-A15 fans. This allows the NH-D15S to provide state-of-the-art heatsink performance while maintaining superior RAM and PCIe compatibility.Excellent RAM compatibilityThanks to its recessed lower fins, the NH-D15S provides 65mm clearance for tall memory heatsinks, making it compatible with most high end modules on the market. As the lower fins are recessed on both sides of the heatsink, compatibility is excellent not only on LGA115x and AMD, but also on LGA2011 where there are RAM slots on both sides of the socket.Asymmetrical layout for better PCIe compatibilityAs many current motherboards have the top PCIe x16 slot sitting close to the socket, bigger heatsinks tend to block it. Due to its asymmetrical layout, the fin-stack of the NH-D15S is off-set towards the upper edge of the motherboard when installed in standard orientation. This allows it to clear the top PCIe x16 slot on most current µATX and ATX motherboard.* NF-A15 140mm fanComplying with Noctua’s AAO standard and featuring sophisticated aerodynamic design measures such as Flow Acceleration Channels, the NF-A15 has quickly built up a reputation as one of the best 140mm fans on the market.  Dual-fan readyUsing the supplied extra fan clips, the NH-D15S can be upgraded with either a second round-frame 140mm fan with 120mm mounting holes (such as the NF-A15) for maximum performance or a common 120mm fan (such as the NF-F12) for improving performance while maintaining compatibility with RAM modules of up to 45mm height.PWM support and Low-Noise AdaptorThe NF-A15 premium fan supplied with the NH-D15S supports PWM for convenient automatic speed control through the motherboard. In addition, the maximum fan speed can be reduced from 1500 to 1200rpm using the supplied Low-Noise Adaptor for even quieter operation.",
