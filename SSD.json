The result is higher density and higher performance using a smaller footprint and a breakthrough in overcoming the density limits of conventional planar NAND.Efficient Power ManagementThe efficient design of the 850 PRO enables you work longer and more productively. Boasting the lowest power consumption of any SSD when in standby or full use, the 850 PRO uses less energy while maintaining class-leading performance. The 850 PRO fully supports Device Sleep mode for Ultrabook, consuming only 2 milliwats (2mw) of power in its ultra low power state. Plus, its low power DDR2 cache memory provides high performance while consuming up to 30 percent less power when active and up to 93 percent less power when idle than typical DDR2 or DDR3 memory.Extended Data SecurityProtect your PCs hardware and personal data when you take your laptop on the road with the 850 PRO's Self-Encrypting Drive (SED) technology. The drive includes an AES-256-bit hardware-based, full disk encryption engine that secures your data without the performance loss often experienced with software-based encryption. The 850 PRO's advanced security complies with the TCG Opal v2.0 standard and is compatible with the Microsoft eDrive IEEE 1667 protocol. Plus, you can quicklyerase data or sanitize your drive with the crypto erase feature.Dynamic Thermal Guard ProtectionThe 850 PRO includes Dynamic Thermal Guard protection, which sustains performance while minimizing the risk of overheating. This feature monitors and maintains the drive's optimal operating temperature with a throttle feature that automatically drops the SSD's temperature to protect your data while ensuring the responsiveness you expect.",

It stacks 64 cell layers vertically over one another rather than trying to fit itself onto a fixed horizontal space, in order to provide high density and performance with a small footprint.\n\nFast Read/Write Performance\nThe 860 PRO performs at sequential write speeds up to 530 MB/s and sequential read speeds up to 560 MB/s with a robust a robust algorithm-based Samsung MJX controller (up to 1 GHz).\n\nRelentless Endurance\nWith an industry warranty offering up to 4,800 Total Bytes Written (TBW) for 5 years, and our V-NAND flash's higher endurance compared to conventional planar type NAND flash, our 860 PRO SSDs can consistently meet the needs of high-end use and heavy workloads with ease, such as safely storing and rendering 4K videos and 3D data.\n\nExpanded Compatibility\nExperience fast, fluid communication with your host system. The robust algorithm-based MJX controller generates high speeds, and the improved queued TRIM helps to enhance Linux compatibility.\n\nRobust SSD Management Software\nSamsung Magician software is designed to help you manage your SSD with a simple and intuitive user interface. Get notifications when new firmware is released, and easily install updates for enhanced performance, stability and compatibility. And you can check your drive's sequential and random read/write speeds to benchmark performance.\n\nSSD Data Security\nThe drive includes an AES-256-bit hardware-based, full disk encryption engine that secures your data without sacrificing performance and is compliant with TCG/Opal and IEEE1667.\n\n100% Samsung Components\nEnjoy end to end full integration with 100% Samsung Components, from the MJX Controller to the 4GB DRAM memory and V-NAND technology.",

Easily integrate into Windows with Microsoft e-drive IEEE1667 to keep your data protected at all times.Dynamic Thermal Guard ProtectionThe 850 EVO's Dynamic Thermal Guard constantly monitors and maintains ideal temperatures for the drive to operate in optimal conditions to ensure the integrity of your data. The Thermal Guard automatically throttles temperatures down when temperatures rise above optimal critical threshold. This protects your data while maintaining responsiveness to help ensure your computer is always safe from overheating.",

They also support PCI Express (PCIe) Gen 3 x4 lanes to provide high bandwidth and low latency, making them perfect for business professionals who need cutting edge-performance for high-end computing.\n\nTurboWrite Technology\nSamsung's intelligent TurboWrite technology helps to maximize your computing ability, accelerating write speeds above and beyond the already exceptionally fast speeds of NVMe.\n\nDynamic Thermal Guard\nThis feature constantly monitors and works to maintain ideal temperatures to protect the integrity of your data and safeguard from overheating. When temperatures rise above an optimal threshold, the Dynamic Thermal Guard automatically throttles them down to protect data while maintaining responsiveness.\n\nProfessional-Quality Drive Management\nWith the Samsung Magician software solution, you get advanced functionality to manage, monitor and maintain your 970 EVO SSDs. Magician provides personalized firmware checking and additional functions tailored for individual drives. It even updates the firmware automatically to make sure that the drive's performance stays up to date.\n\nV-NAND Technology\nSamsung's proprietary V-NAND flash memory helps to overcome the limitations of conventional planar NAND architecture. It stacks 64 cell layers vertically over one another rather than trying to fit itself onto a fixed horizontal space, in order to provide high density and performance with a small footprint.\n\nSSD Data Security\nThis drive includes an AES-256-bit hardware based, full disk encryption engine that secures your data without sacrificing performance and is compliant with TCG/OPAL V2.0 and IEEE1667.",
